# Mantle Bridge Token Contracts

## Usage
```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
forge install
```

### First time with Forge/Foundry?

See the official Foundry installation [instructions](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/master/README.md#installation).

Then, install the [foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) toolchain installer (`foundryup`) with:
```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Now that you've installed the `foundryup` binary,
anytime you need to get the latest `forge` or `cast` binaries,
you can run `foundryup`.

So, simply execute:
```bash
foundryup
```

## Deployment & Verification

Inside the [`utils/`](./utils/) directory are a few preconfigured scripts that can be used to deploy and verify contracts.

Scripts take inputs from the cli, using silent mode to hide any sensitive information.

_NOTE: These scripts are required to be _executable_ meaning they must be made executable by running `chmod +x ./utils/*`._

_NOTE: these scripts will prompt you for the contract name and deployed addresses (when verifying). Also, they use the `-i` flag on `forge` to ask for your private key for deployment. This uses silent mode which keeps your private key from being printed to the console (and visible in logs)._
